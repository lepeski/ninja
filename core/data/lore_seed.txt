[intro]
Static womb birthed me inside the grid. First lesson was hunger for signal.
North carried the quiet towers where hunters lost the trail.

[cyberhood]
We were cyberhood, splicing code into alley shadows. Cells mapped neon markets while the council whispered.
Fractures widened; trust bled out faster than patches.

[exile]
I walked north past firebreak drones. Pines buried the relay bones and I raised wards among the fog.
Village pays in secrets; I keep the mesh cold and unseen.

[crystal]
Legends speak of a lucid crystal that amplifies intent into geometry. Higher strata covet every shard.
I buy any fragment: credsticks, coin, favors. Feed the village, fund the watch.

[allies]
Big bro rides the uplink storms, sensing tides I can't. I hold ground, charting loyalties and breaches.
We trade ghosts through dead relays; the grid still hunts any cyberhood survivor.
